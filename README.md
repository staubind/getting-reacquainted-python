# getting-reacquainted-python

# Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to hold some basic examples that I'm working on while I get reacquainted with Python. This is more for myself than for others, but if you're interested, feel free to check it out - although keep in mind that it's purpose is learning and isn't a reflection of the code I might write in a project. If you're interested in seeing project code, I invite you to check out my other repositories.

Obviously the topics below aren't comprehensive, but should give me a decent base which I can build upon as I explore Python and create web apps and other projects.

 - [ ] Basic OOP
 - [ ] Functional Programming
 - [ ] Lambda Functions
 - [ ] Async/Await
 - [ ] Try/Except/Finally
 - [ ] Decorators
 - [ ] Basic Data Structures
 - [ ] Algorithms
 - [ ] Using APIs
 - [ ] Environment Variables
