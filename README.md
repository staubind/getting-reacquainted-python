# getting-reacquainted-python

# Purpose:

The purpose of this repository is to hold some basic examples that I'm working on while I get reacquainted with Python. This is more for myself than for others, but if you're interested, feel free to check it out - although keep in mind that it's purpose is learning and isn't a reflection of the code I might write in a project. If you're interested in seeing project code, I invite you to check out my other repositories.

Obviously the topics below aren't comprehensive, but should give me a decent base which I can build upon as I explore Python and create web apps and other projects.
